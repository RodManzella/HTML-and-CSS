CSS Theory #1: Conflicts Between Selectors

What happens when there are multiple CSS rules that apply to the same elements

-There are multiple selectors selecting the same element. which one of them applies

- All of them. All rules and properties are applied

- But there are conflicting font-size declarations! is it 18px, 20px, or 22px

-When the are multiple the samedeclarations for the exact same element, then what matters are the selectors
            5)Declarations marked !important

            4)Inline style(style atrribute in HTML)

            3) ID(#)selector     multiple   -------------->  Last selector in code applies
                
            2) Class(.) or pseudo-class(:) selector     multiple   -------------->  Last selector in code applies

            1)Element Selector(p, div, li, etc.)    multiple   -------------->  Last selector in code applies

            0) Universal selector(*)
          



.author{
    font-style: italic;
    font-size: 18px;
}


#author-text{
    font-size: 20px;
}

p,
li{
    font-family: sans-serif;
    color: #444444;
    font-size: 22px;
}


-There is an ID selector(#author-text), so for the conflicting font-size property, this is the selector that applies

CSS Theory #2: Inheritance and the Universal Selector

-Inheritance is a mechanism by which some styles get their values inherited from parent elements to child elements

- Not all properties get inherited, it is mostly the ones about text

- Inherited styles are easily overwriten whenever there is any rule that applies for the same property

- inherited values are the ones that have the lowest priority

- We use the strategy of putting text properties in the body selector, and then we can overwrite the way we want



HOW INHERITANCE WORKS:

    <body>                                                          
        <nav>
            This is the navigation
        </nav>

        <h1> My website </h1>

        <p>
            The text in this paragraph
            is completely irrelevant
        </p>

    </body>


body{
    color: #444;
    font-family: sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;

    border-top: 10px solid #1098ad;            The border property does not get inherited(impractical)
}


elements nav, h1 and p inherit color, font-family and font-size properties

-Not all properties get inherited. ItÂ´s mostly ones related to text: font-family, font-size, font-weightt, font-style,
color, line-height, letter-spacing, text-align, text-transform, text-shadow, list-style, etc.
