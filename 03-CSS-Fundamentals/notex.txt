CSS Theory #1: Conflicts Between Selectors

What happens when there are multiple CSS rules that apply to the same elements

-There are multiple selectors selecting the same element. which one of them applies

- All of them. All rules and properties are applied

- But there are conflicting font-size declarations! is it 18px, 20px, or 22px

-When the are multiple the samedeclarations for the exact same element, then what matters are the selectors


             3) ID(#)selector     multiple   -------------->  Last selector in code applies
                
            2) Class(.) or pseudo-class(:) selector     multiple   -------------->  Last selector in code applies

            1)Element Selector(p, div, li, etc.)    multiple   -------------->  Last selector in code applies

            0) Universal selector(*)
