Page Layout vs Component Layout

==============================================================================================
The 3 ways of building layouts with CSS


1) Float layouts

- The old way of building layouts of all sizes, using the float CSS property.
Still used but getting outdated fast.


2) Flexbox

- Modern way of laying out elements in a 1-dimensional row without using floats.
Perfect for component layouts

3) CSS grid

- For laying out element ina fully-fledged 2-dimensional grid. Perfect for page layouts and complex components

===================================================================================================
Absolute Positioning VS floats

Absolute Positioning:

-Element is removed from the normal flow

-No impact on surrounding, might overlap them

- We use top, bottom, left or right to offset the element
from its relatively positioned container

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Floats:

- Element is removed from the normal flow

- Text and Inline elements will wrap around the floated element

-The container element will not adjust its height to the floated element.
Container element collapses height
